		<h3>About Sikshana</h3>
		<p>Sikshana is a unique effort started by the Sikshana Foundation (a unit of Sivasri Charitable Trust) that aims at improving learning levels in the government primary schools through better access and delivery of education. Sikshana Program enters its tenth year of inception with several milestones to its credit. Being a child centric Program, Sikshana today reaches out to 1,80,000 children across 1115 schools in the State of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat.</p> 
        <p>Sikshana aims to improve the quality of education in Government primary schools at a typical cost of Rs. 300 per annum per child. The improvement is measured in quantified scales in each school under standard test conditions. The program is essentially focused on decentralization and empowerment of the adopted schools. Sikshana acts primarily as a facilitator and not as provider of solutions.</p><br>

		<h3>Context</h3>
		<p>According to data, 76% of the rural households in India send their children to government or government aided schools. The recent ASER assessment data of all Indian states submitted by Pratham states that only 40% of the children studying in V class in rural government schools in India can read level 2 (Class II) texts and only 20% of them can do division. In Karnataka, only 50% of children in class V standard can read level II (Class II) Kannada text, while less than 20% of them can do division. Sikshana felt the need to improve the quality of education in government schools.</p><br>

 		<h3>Relevance of Sikshana Program</h3> 
		<p>Sikshana believes that by providing need based resources to the schools, the quality of education can be improved. Decentralization and empowerment of the schools can lead to a healthy public education system. At present, the expense incurred by the government in educating a child in this system works out to anywhere between Rs 7000 to Rs 10,000 per annum. A program which seeks to get optimum learning levels at a cost of Rs 300 per child - inclusive of the direct and monitoring costs- is an eminently desirable one, if the targets are realized.
